        </div><div class="column" id="col-1"><!--Column 1 starts here-->
			<h3>Paintings</h3>
			<p>Most of my paintings are created with my large assortment of acrylic paints. I have experimented with different types of paints in the past, such as oils and watercolors, and while I enjoyed those, I found acrylics to be my favorite kind to work with. Its quick-drying properties and vibrant colors make it easy to create small details and portray colorful scenes in a beatiful way.</p>

			<h3>Drawings</h3>
			<p>My drawings are made up of many different materials. I love to experiment with various drawing tools and the ones I have found myself to use most are Prismacolor Colored Pencils, regular graphite pencils, and ink pens. The material I enjoy working with most for drawings is my set of Prismacolor pencils. Their extremely pigmented color is perfect for creating vibrant, detailed drawings.</p>

			<h3>Body Art</h3>
			<p>Body art is, in my opinion, definitely one of the most "out there" forms of art. I mess around with body art as a way to keep my styles interesting and to express my creativity. For body art, I either do something as simple as draw on a friend with an ink pen, or take out a facepaint palette and go to town. When I use facepaint, I use a Wolfe Face Art palette because the paints in this set are extremely pigmented and do not become diluted as easily.</p>

			<h3>Digital Art</h3>
			<p>For digital art, I stick with programs such as Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. These applications make graphic design fun and interesting and have a wide variety of tools to help you create whatever designs you could think up.</p>
